Node splitting algorithm:
For each splitting, I used a measurement called Percentage Measurement to do the splitting.
First I will calculate the percentage of true labels and false labels in both splited sets.
If for s1(the left side set after splitting) the percentage of true labels is larger than false 
labels, I will add the percentage of true labels in s1 and the percentage of false labels in s2 
as the performance. If for s1 the percentage of false labels is larger than true labels, I will add the 
percentage of false labels in s1 and the percentage of true labels in s2 as the performance.
