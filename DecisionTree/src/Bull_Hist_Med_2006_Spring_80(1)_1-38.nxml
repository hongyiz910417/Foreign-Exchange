This paper studies how these influences of hostility and commerce shaped the medical establishment of the English East India Company. It begins by analyzing the struggle of the medical establishment to cope with military and logistical requirements; it then shows how the Coromandel trade provided a peculiar dynamic to the practice of medicine in Madras. By aligning the history of medicine with that of trade, the paper traces the parallel trajectories of intellectual and material wealth. The development of modern medicine is seen as a process of adjusting to and engaging with diverse ideas and items&#x02014;sometimes co-opting them, sometimes realigning them in new modes of production.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Madras</kwd><kwd>&#x0201c;black doctor,&#x0201d;</kwd><kwd>surgeon</kwd><kwd>Country trade</kwd><kwd>bazaar</kwd><kwd>Tanjore pills</kwd><kwd>Coromandel</kwd><kwd>hospital</kwd><kwd>English East India Company</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="38"/><word-count count="123"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The port of Madras (Chennai) on the Coromandel Coast of India was founded in 1639, and Fort St. George in the 1640s, by the English East India Company (EEIC, 1600&#x02013;1858), a joint-stock corporation of English merchants, as part of their network of warehouses or &#x0201c;factories&#x0201d; protected by military settlements and forts across South and East Asia. Throughout<xref ref-type="other" id="P-1" rid="P-1"/> the eighteenth century, Madras was a site of continuous warfare sparked mostly by trading and territorial interest. The battes were with the French (the First and Second Carnatic Wars, 1744&#x02013;48 and 1749&#x02013;54) as well as with the rulers of Mysore, Hyder Ali, and Tipu Sultan (the four Mysore Wars of 1767&#x02013;69, 1780&#x02013;84, 1790&#x02013;92, and 1799). As a direct consequence of these conficts, the establishment of medical services soon followed the setting up of the town and the fort, formally coming into existence with the founding of the hospital in 1664.</p><p>Historians of the emergence of medical institutions and hospitals, particularly those of the EEIC, from the late seventeenth century have mainly focused on the theme of war, sometimes characterizing the medical practices as &#x0201c;military medicine.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>1</sup></xref> I will suggest in this paper that military medicine in Madras was not only about survival in the battlefield: it was also shaped by the material culture of trade and the politicai appropriation subsequent to the military campaigns that unfolded in this region over the eighteenth century. I will address some of the key issues in our growing recognition of the role of the empire in shaping European scientific and medical knowledge,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>2</sup></xref> and I will highlight the need to understand the flow of ideas in terms of material and political shifts, particularly in the colonies.</p><p>In the first part of the paper I discuss how the medical establishment was created by the nature of the EEIC's settlement and military activities in Madras. The next section demonstrates how commerce, the chief concern of the EEIC, was also crucial to the growth of that establishment. The practice of medicine in Madras needs to be mapped along the trade routes, in the items of barter and in the markets of exchange, to construct a history of treatment enriched by trade.</p><p>Finally, I will show that medicine in Madras has to be understood in terms of the shifting political, military, economic, and intellectual dynamics on the Coromandel Coast. At a more general level I will show how modern medicine developed as an attempt to adjust to and engage with the multifarious collections of ideas and items&#x02014;sometimes co-opting them, sometimes realigning them in new modes of production.

In 1664 William Gyford and Jeremy Sambrooke wrote to the governor of Madras, Sir Edward Winter, saying that a hospital and regimented health care were necessary to treat the English soldiers:</p><disp-quote><p>soe the fresh souldiers which came forth this year takeing up their habitation in the bleake winde in the hall, fell sick. Four of them are dead: about tenn remaine at this time very sick and complaine (and it seems not without Reason) that the wages are not suffcient to supply them with the necessary now in this time of their sickness. Soe, Rather than see Englishmen dropp away like doggs in that Manner for want of Christian Charity towards them, we have thought it very Convenient that they might have an house on purpose for them, and people appointed to looke after them and to see that nothing comes in to them, neither of meate nor drinke, but what the Doctor alloweth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>4</sup></xref></p></disp-quote><p content-type="continued">Thus the earliest hospital in Fort St. George was established on 16 November 1664 with John Clarke as the first surgeon. In 1688, for want of space, it was moved to the northern end of the barracks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>5</sup></xref></p><p>As pointed out by Mark Harrison, it was only in the mid-eighteenth century that the expansionist policy and &#x0201c;open warfare&#x0201d; of the Company led to the employment of regular forces in Bengal and Madras Presidencies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>6</sup></xref> Until then the hospital in Madras remained within the fort and served only the European military and civilian population within it. The<xref ref-type="other" id="P-3" rid="P-3"/> wars with the French had brought unprecedented numbers of European troops, stores, and artillery to India.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>7</sup></xref> In the middle of the Second Carnatic War, in 1750, Commander-in-Chief Bascowen took possession of the hospital to serve as barracks in the fort. Surgeon Andrew Munro subsequently wrote to the Madras Military Board that the hospital site had become rather &#x0201c;crowded&#x0201d; and the army had taken up the apartments of the mates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>8</sup></xref> By this time new expansion was taking place outside the White Town (demarcated for the European population), for the population had outgrown it and the fort area lacked adequate housing. By the 1750s the original Indian settlement in the Black Town was demolished to expand the buffer zone around the fort. The Indian population was now gathered within the suburban quarters of Muthialpet and Peddanaikpet, the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; Black Town.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>9</sup></xref>Peddanaikpet was the area where most of the Vel-lalar groups, including the EEIC's <italic>dubashes,</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>10</sup></xref> were settled,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>11</sup></xref> and it was to Peddanaikpet that in 1752 the hospital was ordered to be shifted outside the fort for the first time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>12</sup></xref></p><p>Subsequent wars also created the need for enlargement of the hospital facilities. In November 1758 the surgeons Robert Turing, James Wilson, and T. S. Hancock sent a comprehensive proposal to George Pigot, president and governor in council of Fort St. George, for a new hospital&#x02014;the<xref ref-type="other" id="P-4" rid="P-4"/> first outline of a modern hospital in Madras. The new hospital was to be divided into separate wards for patients suffering from fevers, fluxes, venereal diseases, malignant fevers, and smallpox, and for invalids and &#x0201c;Incurables&#x0201d;; there was also to be a room each for operations and the dispensary. Every patient was to be examined by the surgeon or one of the assistants upon admission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>13</sup></xref> The diets of the patients were also specifed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>14</sup></xref> Assistant surgeons were to help the principal surgeon in performing operations. One of the assistants was also to act as the apothecary, prepare and distribute medicines, give injections, and salivate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>15</sup></xref> patients with the help of two Indian <italic>coolies</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>16</sup></xref> who were also to act as cooks. The Indian under-assistants and the <italic>dubashes</italic> were to make and prepare dressings as well as to help in preparing medicines by pounding the mortars. Local women were to clean the wards and provide the hospital with water, and a &#x0201c;head coolie&#x0201d; was to supervise the Indian subordinates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>The Military Board initially approved most of the submissions, but war caused these plans to be shelved. In May 1771 the Board finally resolved to accept the proposals for the construction of a new hospital building, following closely the administrative and architectural outlines of the 1758 plan.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>18</sup></xref> In 1772, the present-day double-block buildings of the Madras General Hospital were inaugurated. Today the hospital stands in central Chennai, across the road from the headquarters of the Southern Railway.</p><p>The practice of medicine in Madras also had to engage with battlefeld and logistic concerns. Victory did not ensure well-being in a hostile land. In January 1760 the English recorded one of their most decisive victories in Deccan, at Wandiwash against General Lally's French troops. The victorious General Eyre Coote, however, found the battle scenes &#x0201c;dreadful&#x0201d; due to the lack of medical support in the field:</p><disp-quote><p>Such a multitude of poor objects, and not in my power to give them the least assistance for want of every one necessary requisite for an hospital.

In 1774 Gilbert Pasley and James Anderson wrote to the Board about the European medicines received for 1773, which had arrived &#x0201c;much damaged on account of the careless and injudicious Package of them,&#x0201d; and they added that the &#x0201c;supply of surgical Instruments is likewise greatly deficient.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>28</sup></xref> In 1787 the Hospital Board wrote to the government about an &#x0201c;Evil&#x0201d;&#x02014;the poor condition and quality of medicines sent from England:</p><disp-quote><p>The Hospital Board beg leave to take this opportunity of informing Government of the imperfection and indeed the inutility of several of the Medicines brought from Europe, especially Cantharides or blistering flies, the efficacy of which is so considerable in many critical disorders, and the consequent disappointment so great.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>29</sup></xref></p></disp-quote><p content-type="continued">The situation was particularly grave in the provinces of the Presidency, which depended on Madras for their supply of European medicine.

This is where the story of medicine at Madras is linked to the main concern of the EEIC, its trade in the Indian Ocean world.</p></sec><sec><title>Medicine in the Marketplace</title><p>The practice of medicine beyond Europe in the eighteenth century posed many challenges for the Europeans. Apart from war, the climate and the customs of the Coromandel Coast also troubled the European constitution and conscience. Charles Curtis, a surgeon from England who briefy visited the hospital during 1782&#x02013;83, found it and its surroundings rather inhospitable:</p><disp-quote><p>The country round was more than once overrun, and plundered by the horse troops of Hyder Ally. So that our supply, even of fresh meat, and much more of vegetables and fruits, was by far too scanty. And a few imperfectly cultivated and unripened fruits, with the cocoa-nut juice called <italic>toady,</italic> was all we could procure for our scorbutics. Another source of unhealthiness arises from the situation of the town, and fort of Madras itself, built upon a low, flat and sandy beach, and surrounded almost entirely by stagnant swamps, or ponds of stagnant water, which are not only a receptacle for every sort of corruption and filth, but have their edges, as well as the beach on the other side, covered at all hours of the day with the natives, in the act of relieving nature from their burdens, to take advantage of the water for washing afterwards, which is their invariable custom.

Throughout the years of war the EEIC was establishing itself as the principal trading power in these parts. Madras, as its stronghold in this expansion, was the hub of various networks and arbitrations and, as suggested by some historians, a site not of degeneration but of &#x0201c;vitality.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>34</sup></xref>This meant that the surgeons of Madras were placed in an interesting confluence of ideas and ingredients, and consequently, their intellectual lives were eclectic.

The local nayak or the nawab of Carnatic had little visible control over Madras, a port city established by the British. As Holden Furber described it: &#x0201c;Fort St. George was much more impressive than Fort William [at Calcutta]. The Governor and Council actually ruled over a sizable local population, composing caste disputes and making authority felt well outside the so-called &#x02018;white&#x02019; and &#x02018;black&#x02019; towns of Madras, especially in the countryside where the weavers of the &#x02018;Company's cloths&#x02019; lived.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>40</sup></xref></p><p>While problems of infrastructure and logistics plagued the medical establishment of Madras, surgeons from very early on had discovered other sources for the supply of medicines.

In the early decades of the century doctors like Robert Turing were generally engaged in private trade.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>53</sup></xref> Until 1697 the medical offcers bought drugs from the bazaar for hospital use and submitted the bills at long intervals; in 1697, the Council stressed that the surgeons needed to submit such bills monthly.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>54</sup></xref> Trade was crucial to medicine in terms of proft as well. In his advertisement for Samuel Brown's Madras collections in the <italic>Philosophical Transactions,</italic> James Petiver referred to an earlier discovery of a root in the East which was found to be particularly useful in epileptic and convulsive diseases, justifying, according to Petiver, the need to &#x0201c;better understand&#x0201d; such medicines and &#x0201c;to have them in greater plenty, so that even the poorer sort of People may receive beneft by it at a much moderate price, and the Merchant receive advantage by trading in an new Commodity.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>55</sup></xref></p><p>Science and trade were thus closely interlinked. The main Madras contact of William Roxburgh, an EEIC botanist posted at Samulcottah (or Samalkot) in Andhra Pradesh, two hundred miles north of Madras, was Andrew Ross, the most prominent trading agent in that city involved in country trade. Ross procured books in Madras to send them to Samulcottah for Roxburgh; Roxburgh sent Ross a breadfruit plant, to be <xref ref-type="other" id="P-12" rid="P-12"/> forwarded to St. Helena. The two men corresponded regularly regarding the experiments on the cultivation of cinnamon, tobacco, indigo, and teak at Roxburgh's station at Samulcottah. Ross played an active role in propagating within his own network the scientifc virtues of Roxburgh's discovery of the astringent bark <italic>Swietenia febrifuga</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>56</sup></xref></p><p>But there were also other links, less obvious, between &#x0201c;Country trade&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Country medicine.&#x0201d; The term &#x0201c;Country medicine&#x0201d; was used by Europeans for the <italic>local</italic> medicines procured and used in South Asia and the West Indies (the term &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; being the suggestive one). My suggestion here is not simply that Country trade amplifed the use of Country medicine. Rather, this comparison can be used as an analytical tool to understand how trade can be seen as a metaphor for medicine, particularly for this period; how it signifes European involvement in the &#x0201c;native&#x0201d; or the local; and how that shaped the identities and content of both. In the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary,</italic> the &#x0201c;Anglo-Indian&#x0201d; connotation of &#x0201c;Country&#x0201d; is defned as &#x0201c;Of or belonging to India (or other foreign country), as distinguished from European; native.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>57</sup></xref> This particular meaning is derived from eighteenth-century texts like Alexander Hamilton's <italic>New Account of the East Indies</italic> (1727) on trade in the Indian Ocean region.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>58</sup></xref> The term &#x0201c;native&#x0201d; as commonly used by Europeans to describe the local or the indigenous population of non-European parts signifes a &#x0201c;rootedness&#x0201d;&#x02014;as distinct from &#x0201c;European,&#x0201d; to which was attributed a certain mobile and universal quality. At one level similar to trade, medicine in these parts tended to have two distinct orientations: Country medicine, and European medicine. At another level, the &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; and the &#x0201c;metropolitan&#x0201d; were linked in the European use of these traditions and in the dispatching of &#x0201c;native&#x0201d; pills, plants, and texts to Europe either as novelties or for &#x0201c;analysis&#x0201d; by the scientifc community back home.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>59</sup></xref></p><p>The history of eighteenth-century Country trade is rather checkered.

The Europeans here interacted with local merchant communities like the Armenians and Chettiars in developing coastal trade between Madras and Bengal, leading ultimately to China.

The products had a long and syncretic history of trade and network, often being brought over from other regions and used locally as medicinal ingredients. The Europeans similarly used them as ingredients for their own medicines, and also bought &#x0201c;pills,&#x0201d; barks, and roots commonly in use in the surrounding regions. The <italic>Materia Medica of Hindoostan</italic> published in 1813 by Whitelaw Ainslie (superintendent surgeon, Madras) describes the complex lineages of bazaar medicines, which were &#x0201c;either the produce of Hindoostan, or&#x02026;brought to it from Asiatic countries, and are to be met with in the Bazars of populous Towns; including many Drugs of the Tamool, Arabian, and Persian Materia Medica.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>66</sup></xref></p><p>Important sites of Country trade like Machilipatnam also became signifcant points of procuring Country medicine.

In 1766 the Society obtained the monopoly for supplying medicine to the EEIC. This became the core of its business, and a period of flourishing profits in the late eighteenth century followed. In the 1820s it was the chief supplier of the huge Indian army of approximately 300,000 men. The Society boasted: &#x0201c;the whole army of India (we believe exclusively) is served under the direction of the Hon United India Company from our establishment.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b180-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>180</sup></xref> The Navy Stock of the Society yielded an average of &#x000a3;20,160 a year for the first decade of the nineteenth century,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b181-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>181</sup></xref> and throughout most of the nineteenth century, trade and the Navy Stock were the mainstays of the Society's activities and prosperity.

In 1800 Thomas Evans, who had very recently joined the Madras establishment as an assistant surgeon, made a proposal for the establishment of a dispensary in the Black Town. Evans had two justifications: first, such a dispensary would help to promote European medicine in these parts, thereby making commercial proft for the EEIC; second, it would help to suppress all &#x0201c;irregular practitioners and vendors of medicine in Black Town.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b183-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>183</sup></xref> The Medical Board, however, rejected the plan and suggested that the surgeon posted in the Black Town and jail should check the &#x0201c;spurious&#x0201d; practitioners; a dispensary whose purpose would be to &#x0201c;dispose of as much medicine wholesale or retail as possible&#x0201d; would have, according to them, little effect to that regard.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b184-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>184</sup></xref> The government, on the other hand, recognized the merits of Evans's plans.<xref ref-type="other" id="P-35" rid="P-35"/> On 4 November the Governor in Council resolved that such a dispensary was to be established, which &#x0201c;would not only relieve the Company from an immediate expence, <italic>but may ultimately increase the demand for European Medicines to an object of commercial importance.&#x0201d;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b185-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>185</sup></xref> They opined that the dispensary would also help to stop the &#x0201c;clandestine sale of medicine&#x0201d; and other &#x0201c;spurious medical practices&#x0201d; and to &#x0201c;introduce into India the knowledge of European Pharmacy, to remove by degrees the errors of ignorance and to extend the practice of scientific adepts.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b186-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>186</sup></xref></p><p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, bazaar medicine had come a long way in its metropolitan participation.

On the other hand, networks, collaborations, and negotiations were vital to European endurance in these distant lands, and trade was both the means and the metaphor of these exchanges. The &#x0201c;rise&#x0201d; of the bazaar from the eighteenth century has been seen as a new &#x0201c;distinct world&#x0201d; of sophisticated negotiation and bargaining developed by the indigenous<xref ref-type="other" id="P-36" rid="P-36"/> trading communities in the wake of European imperialism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b188-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>188</sup></xref> In this paper I have stressed the need to understand the nature of these negotiations and accumulations against the backdrop of trade and dominance.</p><p>Since it was not just medicine that was being bartered here, the general economic history of Coromandel trade becomes relevant. A comparative analysis of Britain and South India in the eighteenth century in terms of wages, prices of grain, and agricultural productivity shows that the image of &#x0201c;impoverished masses&#x0201d; of India, as painted by European travelers, was misleading. Such an analysis has not only challenged concepts of Oriental despotism and static and self-sufficient villages, but also has hinted at the need to rethink Europe's industrial revolution, which could be seen as a response to the &#x0201c;economic dynamism outside,&#x0201d; Britain's answer to India's competitive challenge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b189-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>189</sup></xref></p><p>On the other hand, as one of the largest employers in eighteenth-century Britain, the EEIC shaped British middle-class earning and spending. The EEIC clerks were more able to earn higher salaries, compared with other banking, commercial, and governmental employees between 1750 and 1850, and the economy generally benefted from vigorously escalating salaries in these classic years of industrial revolution, which in turn led to domestic demand for the goods of the new industrial sector.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b190-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>190</sup></xref> There were of course the accumulated credits from India, which helped to finance Britain's land warfare with the French.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b191-80.1chakrabarti"><sup>191</sup></xref></p><p>It is necessary to align the history of medicine with economic history: not only to write an economic history of medicine, but also to align the trajectories of intellectual and material wealth.
