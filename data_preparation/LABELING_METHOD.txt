My way of organizing the data is that:
First define a window sizeï¼ˆcurrently it's 10 minutes, but it can be easily changed).
Then for each type of currency, I will merge the transactions within the window size into a new line,
and in the new line I will add features of bid max, bid min, bid avg and spread avg computed from all 
the transactions within this window.
Label: If avg bid is lower than next window's(in another word, the future one), label
		this line as true, else label this line as false.


Column explanation:
Column 1: currency type, ex. USDJPY
Column 2: date time. Currently the merging window size is 10 minutes, but it can be easily changed.
Column 3: bid Minimum. The Minimum bid value within this window.
Column 4: bid Maximum. The Maximum bid value within this window.
Column 5: bid average. The average bid value within this window.
Column 6: spread average. The average spread value within this window.
Column 7: label flag. If avg bid is lower than next window's(in another word, the future one), label
		  this line as true, else label this line as false.
